# 10-Computer-vision-Projects-for-begineers

This repository includes different types of computer vision projects that can be done using OpenCV package of python and tensorflow for begineers to learn computer vision.

1) Face dectection using OpenCV
  [Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/Face-recognition-using-python)

This is like the Hello world of Computer vision.

2) Warp perspective using Opencv
  [Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/warp_perspective)

3) Virtual Paint
  [Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/Virtual_paint)

4) Face Mask detection
  [Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/Face-Mask-detection---3)

5) Image captioning using Flicker dataset
  [Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/Image-Captioning-using-Flicker_dataset)
This is a combination of Computer vision and Natural Language Processing.

6) Neural Style Transfer

10) Object tracking using YOLO v8
  [Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/YOLOv8_Segmentation_DeepSORT_Object_Tracking)
Different images transformation
2) Edge and contour Detection
3) Gender based cleaning algorithm
4) Virtual Paint
5) Face and Smile detection
6) Face mask detection system for public safety.
7) Warp perspective
8) AI response drone for SAR
