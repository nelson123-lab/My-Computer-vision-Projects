# My Computer vision projects

This repository includes different types of computer vision projects that was done using OpenCV package of python and tensorflow. Some of them are personal projects and remaining are done by following tutorials.
1) Different images transformation
  [Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/Different-Image-transformations-using-opencv.git)

2) Edge and contour Detection
  [Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/Edge-and-Contour-Detection.git)
  
4) Face dectection using OpenCV
  [Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/Face-recognition-using-python)

2) Warp perspective using Opencv
  [Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/warp_perspective)

3) Virtual Paint
  [Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/Virtual_paint)

4) Face Mask detection
  [Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/Face-Mask-detection---3)

5) Image captioning using Flicker dataset
  [Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/Image-Captioning-using-Flicker_dataset)
This is a combination of Computer vision and Natural Language Processing.

6) Neural Style Transfer

8) DCGAN
  [Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/DCGAN_Neural_Network)

9) Object detection using YOLO V8
  [Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/Object-detection-using-YOLO-v8/settings)

10) Object tracking using YOLO v8

3) Gender based cleaning algorithm
4) Virtual Paint
5) Face and Smile detection
6) Face mask detection system for public safety.
7) Warp perspective
8) AI response drone for SAR
